# My Project Portfolio

## [Project x: Health Insurance Premium Price Analysis](https://choijin.github.io/Health_Insurance_Analysis/) 

Analysis of health insurance premium data using causal inference and machine learning methods
* Conduct power analysis and hypothesis testing to identify relationships between features
* Compare LASSO regression, Ridge regression, and Elastic net regression to identify the regularized regression model that will perform best prediction
* Perform PCA, K-Mean's clustering and XGBoost classifier to create the decision tree to determine oneâ€™s diabetes status

## [Project x: Bank Customer Segmentation Dashboard](https://choijin.github.io/Bank_Customer_Dashboard/) 

Analysis of dummy bank customer data from United Kingdom
* Segmented the customer distributions according to their age, bank balance, location, and gender
* Created an interactive dashboard to derive business insights

## [Additional Tableau Projects](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jin.choi8484/viz/NYCParkCrime_16744573706270/NYCRates) 

Analysis of crime incidents occurring at New York City (NYC) parks to promote for safer parks.
* Conducted data pre-processing after importing a PDF data file
* Combined the PDF data with spatial files using inner join (on park names)
* Designed an attention-grabbing visualisation which can be used to motivate for more police patrols in NYC public parks.

## [Project x: Data Analysis on Research Text Data](https://choijin.github.io/Data_Analysis_Research/)  

During my undergraduate research at NCSU, I conducted data analysis on research grant data retrieved from National Science Foundation.
* Transformed XML formatted non-relational data into a tabular relational data format
* Pre-processed the data by removing any stopwords and missing data
* Performed text analysis using libraries (such as PlaintextCorpusReader and BigramCollocationFinder) to segment the text into single word, two-worded and three-worded phrases and counting its frequencies
* Used various machine learning algorithms (KMeans Clustering, XGBoost, Random Forest, NetworkX) to draw insights
